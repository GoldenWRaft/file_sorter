# Name of your workflow
name: Rust CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Triggers the workflow on pull requests to the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # The "build" job
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Caches the Rust build artifacts to speed up subsequent builds
      - name: Cache Cargo registry and build artifacts
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |

      # 3. Runs 'cargo check' for a quick check of the code
      - name: Run cargo check
        run: cargo check --verbose

      # 4. Runs 'cargo build' to compile the code
      - name: Run cargo build
        run: cargo build --verbose

      # 5. Runs 'cargo test' (even if you don't have tests yet, this is good practice)
      - name: Run cargo test
        run: cargo test --verbose
